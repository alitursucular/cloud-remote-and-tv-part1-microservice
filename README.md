-   [Part 2 - Remote Controller](https://github.com/alitursucular/cloud-remote-and-tv-part2-remote): A digital remote controller which performs channel changes. It also displays the active channel. It is powered using Storybook, styled-components, react-query and Zustand.
-   [Part 3 - TV](https://github.com/alitursucular/cloud-remote-and-tv-part3-tv): A single-page app that pretends to be a television. It displays the channel number and name on top of a static channel image. It is also powered using Storybook, styled-components, react-query and Zustand.
